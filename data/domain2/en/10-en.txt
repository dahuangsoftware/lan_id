Viacom International Media Networks Asia, ex MTV Networks Asia Pacific comprises three distinctly branded television channels, MTV, Nickelodeon and VH1 in the Asia Pacific region reaching more than 300 million households. Since its inception on 1 January 1994, MTV Networks Asia Pacific has been providing localized channels for young audiences across Asia and Australia. Initially established as two MTV channels (MTV Asia and MTV Mandarin), MTV Networks businesses have crossed the continent and every delivery platform by catering to audiences with localized programming in eight different languages across ten MTV channels, eight Nickelodeon channels, four VH1 channels and numerous branded programming blocks across the Asia-Pacific region. The company’s localization initiatives were pioneering and its rapid growth in Asia significantly contributed to MTV becoming the world’s largest television network.
MTV Networks Asia Pacific comprises 17 websites and 21 channels which are seen via 24-hour and programming blocks in various parts of Asia. Unlike the European and Latin American divisions, which are regulated by the headquarters' country main regulating body, the MTV Networks Asia channels are regulated by the individual country's regulation body.
