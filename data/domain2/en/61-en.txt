The first woman to hold the office, she succeeded her father Mufti Mohammad Sayeed in the role, a few months after his death in January 2016. Mehbooba is India’s second Muslim woman chief minister after Syeda Anwara Taimur of Assam. She is the president of the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and was a member of the Indian parliament, representing Anantnag in the 16th Lok Sabha; before she was sworn in as the Chief Minister of J&K.

== Early life ==
Born in 1959 in Akhran Nowpora, she earned her law degree from the University of Kashmir.
Her sister Rubaiya Sayeed was kidnapped when their father was appointed India's Home Minister in 1989 and released after a few days.


== Political career ==
When elections for the state assembly were held in 1996, Mehbooba became one of the most popular members elected from Bijbehara on an Indian National Congress ticket. Her father had returned to the Congress, which he had left in 1987, angry at the alliance that party had formed with its traditional rival in the state, the National Conference. Mehbooba quickly made a mark as the leader of the opposition in the assembly, taking on the government of Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah with asperity.
Mehbooba is one of the few female politicians from Kashmir who is recognized across India. When Mufti Mohammad Sayeed split from the Indian National Congress to form the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 1999, many thought she would be the party president. She deferred to her father's experience, however, and became party vice-president.
She resigned her assembly seat and went on to contest the parliamentary elections in 1999 from Srinagar, where she lost to the sitting member Omar Abdullah but won the Pahalgam seat in the state assembly from South Kashmir, defeating Rafi Ahmed Mir, when assembly elections were held again in 2002. She was elected to the Lok Sabha from Anantnag seat in 2004 and 2014.
After her father's death in January 2016, when he was heading the coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir, she took forward the same alliance with Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), the second time the BJP and the PDP formed a government in Jammu and Kashmir. On 4 April 2016, she took the oath and became the first woman Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir.
On 25 June 2016 she won an Assembly seat in a by-election in Anantnag with the highest margin in any recent elections there.
