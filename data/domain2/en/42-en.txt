Glenrothes with Thornton railway station serves the communities of Glenrothes and Thornton in Fife, Scotland. The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail and is on the Fife Circle Line, 31 1‚ÅÑ4 miles (50.3 km) north of Edinburgh Waverley.


== History ==
The station is situated on the Dunfermline Branch of the Edinburgh and Northern Railway, just west of its divergence from the E&NR main line via a triangular junction. It is a completely new structure, having been built by British Rail with the support of Fife County Council to serve the two communities that it is named after. Glenrothes (as a post-war new town) had never previously had its own station (though Markinch station is nearby) whilst Thornton had lost its station (Thornton Junction) on the main line in October 1969 in the aftermath of the Beeching Axe (services on the line westwards to Cardenden and on the Leven branch had ended at the same time).
The successful inauguration of the Fife Circle Line service in 1989 had seen the Dunfermline branch section reopened to passengers and this provided the catalyst for the construction of the station. It was completed in the spring of 1992 and it was opened to traffic on 11 May that year, at the summer timetable change.
Though it has the appearance of a standard two platform station on a double track line, it is actually sited east of Thornton West Junction, where the double line from Cardenden splits into two parallel single lines that diverge after passing through the station to join the main line. One of these runs southwards to Thornton South Junction and is used by all trains to and from Edinburgh via the coast, whilst the other curves to the north and is used by trains heading for Markinch & Perth or Dundee. As a consequence of this, both platforms are bi-directional (a similar layout exists at Bare Lane in Lancashire) but the southern one (platform 1) is much busier than the northern one (2) due to the service pattern in use on the Fife Circle.


== Services ==
On Mondays to Saturdays, there are three trains per hour to Edinburgh. The majority of services in either direction depart from Platform 1 as noted. Two trains per hour run via Kirkcaldy (one of which terminates/starts here), whilst the other (slightly longer) service runs via Dunfermline Town. In the evenings there is an hourly service via Dunfermline only and on Sundays an hourly service on each route to Edinburgh. There are also limited services to and from Perth and intermediate stations via Markinch & Ladybank; these services use Platform 2.
