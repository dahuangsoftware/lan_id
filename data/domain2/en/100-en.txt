Rock & Roll Jeopardy! is an American television game show created by Scott Sternberg and adapted from the quiz show Jeopardy!. The show debuted on VH1 on August 8, 1998 and ran for four seasons, ending on May 12, 2001. Hosted by Jeff Probst, this version featured largely identical play to the parent program, but highlighted post-1950s popular music trivia rather than focusing on general knowledge. Loretta Fox was the show's original announcer, with Stew Herrera later replacing her.

Instead of the actual amount won during the three rounds of game play, the champions on Rock & Roll Jeopardy! were awarded $5,000, regardless of their score, and non-winners received consolation prizes, which were $2,000 for the second-place contestant and $1,000 for the third-place contestant (like the parent series). For the first two seasons, the clue values were in points, but they were changed to dollars for the final two seasons with the guaranteed minimum for the winner being $5,000. Numerous rock musicians appeared in celebrity editions of the show, playing for charitable organizations of their choice.
As was the case with Jep!, Rock & Roll Jeopardy!'s production involved most of the daily syndicated Jeopardy!'s then-current personnel, and its copyright holder was identified in show credits as Trackdown Productions, Inc. Again, the show was taped at Stage 11 of the Sony Studios, rather than Stage 10. Years after the cancellation, the main Jeopardy! series began to use the spin-off's main theme (an electric-guitar remix of "Think!" written by Steve Kaplan) in its Kids Weeks, Teen Tournaments, and College Championships.
