Mana Ariki, properly known as Manu Ariki, is based in Taumarunui in New Zealand.
Manu Ariki is a marae closely linked to Ngaati Hekeawai of the Whanganui River tribes and Ngaati Maniapoto. The marae was originally the home and farm of the Phillips family (Alex and wife Betty and children). It is now a place of meditation, refuge and shelter.
Manu Ariki Marae is administered by Marae Reservation Trustee's who are in the process of sorting out legal and relationship issues with the Te Kotahitanga Society Inc, a religious group.
