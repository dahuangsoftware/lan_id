Biyu of Baekje (died 455, r. 427–455) was the twentieth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.
According to the Samguk Sagi, he was the eldest son of the 19th king Guisin. The traditional dates of Biyu's rule are based on the Samguk Sagi. On the basis of more contemporaneous Chinese records, Best (1979) has suggested that the years 428 or 429–455 are more plausible.
Within the Korean peninsula, Biyu sought to strengthen Baekje’s relationship with Silla, exchanging ambassadors in 433 and 434. Although Silla was a protectorate of Goguryeo at this time, Silla and Baekje allied themselves against Goguryeo (Naje Dongmaeng Hangul :나제동맹 Hanja :羅濟同盟).
