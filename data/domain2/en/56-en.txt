The London and North Western Railway station at Coalport was situated on the north bank of the River Severn. It formed the terminus of the Coalport Branch Line which ran from Hadley Junction near Oakengates on the LNWR Stafford to Shrewsbury Line.


== History ==
The station was originally named ‘Coalport’ at opening on 17 June 1861. It was later renamed ‘Coalport East’ to avoid confusion with the Severn Valley Railway Coalport station which opened on the opposite bank of the river Severn in 1862.
Coalport East closed to passengers on 6 June 1952, and to freight traffic in 1960.
