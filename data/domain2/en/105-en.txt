Vietnamese military ranks and insignia are specified by the National Assembly of Vietnam through Law on Vietnam People's Army Officer (No: 6-LCT/HĐNN7) on 30 December 1981.
The Vietnam People's Army distinguishes three careerpaths: Officers (sĩ quan), non-commissioned officers (hạ sĩ quan), and enlisted members (chiến sĩ).
Because the shoulder insignia of all ranks are represented by an elongated pentagonal epaulette, they are, hence, either detailed or colour-coded to indicate rank, branch, as well as unit.
The shoulder epaulettes from those of enlisted soldiers to field officers are detailed with a silver crest with an encircled silver star. Those of generals and admirals have fully golden epaulettes with corresponding golden crests and encircled stars.
Ranks can show information about branches of military personnel.
Hem Colour of the ranks can show branches:
Army (ground forces): red
Air Force/ Air defence: azure
Navy: dark-purple
Border Defence: green
Coast Guard: blue.
Army-Air Force-Navy ranks have background are yellow.
Border Defense Force's ranks have background is dark-green and hem colour is red.
Coast Guard's ranks have background is blue and hem colour is yellow.
