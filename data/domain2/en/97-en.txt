NCIS and its characters were originally introduced in a two-part episode of the CBS television series JAG in April 2003. The show premiered on September 23, 2003, in the United States.
Created by Donald P. Bellisario and Don McGill, and executive produced by Bellisario, Shane Brennan, Gary Glasberg, and George Schenck & Frank Cardea, NCIS stars Mark Harmon as Supervisory Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, in charge of NCIS's Major Case Response Team. Based out of the Washington, DC, Navy Yard, the team also includes variously Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander), Anthony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), Eleanor Bishop (Emily Wickersham), Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), Alexandra Quinn (Jennifer Esposito), and Nicholas Torres (Wilmer Valderrama). MI6 agent Clayton Reeves (Duane Henry), forensic specialist Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette), and medical examiners Jimmy Palmer (later Dr. Jimmy Palmer; Brian Dietzen) and Dr. Donald "Ducky" Mallard (David McCallum) also assist the team during these troubled times, while successive Directors Tom Morrow (Alan Dale), Jennifer Shepard (Lauren Holly), and Leon Vance (Rocky Carroll) watch from on-high.
On February 29, 2016, the series was renewed for a fourteenth and fifteenth season. As of October 3, 2017, 332 episodes of NCIS have aired.
