The 1972 Talladega 500 was a NASCAR Winston Cup Series race that took place on August 6, 1972, at Talladega Superspeedway in the American community of Talladega, Alabama.
The race car drivers still had to commute to the races using the same stock cars that competed in a typical weekend's race through a policy of homologation (and under their own power). This policy was in effect until roughly 1975. By 1980, NASCAR had completely stopped tracking the year model of all the vehicles and most teams did not take stock cars to the track under their own power anymore.


== Background ==
Talladega Superspeedway, originally known as Alabama International Motor Superspeedway (AIMS), is a motorsports complex located north of Talladega, Alabama. It is located on the former Anniston Air Force Base in the small city of Lincoln. The track is a Tri-oval and was constructed by International Speedway Corporation, a business controlled by the France Family, in the 1960s. Talladega is most known for its steep banking and the unique location of the start/finish line - located just past the exit to pit road. The track currently hosts the NASCAR series such as the Monster Energy Cup Series, Xfinity Series, and the Camping World Truck Series. Talladega Superspeedway is the longest NASCAR oval with a length of 2.66 miles (4.28 km), and the track at its peak had a seating capacity of 175,000 spectators.


== Summary ==
Bobby Isaac won the pole position award for the race while breezing through the solo qualifying session at speeds up to 190.677 miles per hour (306.865 km/h). Taking place on August 6, 1972, at Talladega Superspeedway in the American community of Talladega, Alabama, it took three hours and twenty-two minutes to resolve the event.

I was going with the old tire anyway.

James Hylton won the race; his reward for a long day's work would involve collecting a $24,865 prize ($142,365.48 when adjusted for inflation). This is a very controversial race because NASCAR used threaded tires and was disastrous for most teams. Hylton won because he didn't have the money to buy the new tires and used old nonthreaded tires. Darrell Waltrip would lead his first laps in the race that would kickstart his nascent NASCAR Winston Cup Series career.
Many drivers were out of the race by lap 5 because of a big crash. By the days end, only 18 cars finished the race and only two cars finished on the lead lap. One lap 188, Hylton and ARCA legend Ramo Stott battled to the finish. Hylton won the race by less than one second. 3rd place Bobby Allison was five laps down. It was Hylton's 2nd and final win in NASCAR.
