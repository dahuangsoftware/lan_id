== Geography ==
Pearcedale is a township and rural locality on the northwestern corner of Western Port, in the northern extremities of the Mornington Peninsula. The land is relatively flat with a rich and sandy soil type ideal for market gardening. Its mangrove saltmarsh coastline on Watson Inlet, west of Quail Island, includes the Langwarrin Creek estuary as well as numerous other small creek estuaries. These mangrove saltmarshes are of international significance and are incorporated within the Yaringa Marine National Park as well as being protected under the United Nations Ramsar Convention. The mangrove saltmarshes are not accessible, by land, to the public.


== History ==


=== General ===
Pearcedale was originally called Langwarrin and was also known at various times as Langwarrin Estate or Old Langwarrin. When the Mornington and Stony Point railway lines opened in the late 1880s, the railway station near the Military Camp (...now a Flora and Fauna Reserve) was named Langwarrin. A new town developed east of the railway station and was locally called New Langwarrin. A meeting of rate payers was held in November 1905 and it was voted to rename the original town Pearcedale, to avoid confusion with this new settlement of New Langwarrin. The name Pearcedale came from local landowner Nathaniel Pearce. Nathaniel and his wife Mary Grace are first listed in the Shire of Cranbourne Rate Books in 1894, when they purchased an orchard on 26 acres (about 10 hectares) at Langwarrin Estate. They had eight children. Mary was a midwife and helped deliver many babies in the area.
The town of Pearcedale had a slow beginning. In 1889 it had a few shops and a Post Office, Public Hall and Primary School. However the depression affected the town and the School closed in 1892, 38 years before the depression began, and the Post Office in 1893. The School re-opened in 1902 and the Post Office in 1907. The original hall burnt down and the replacement was opened on August 23, 1918. This event was witnessed by 400 people, who were entertained with a concert and a dance which finished at 4.00am. The Methodist Church was opened in 1918, the Anglican Church in 1938. Other Community milestones include the establishment of the Tennis club in the 1920s, the Cricket club in 1921, the Football club in 1929, the Progress Association in 1937 and the Fire Brigade in 1940. Electricity was connected in 1957, the Guides and Scouts both formed in 1957, the R.S.L in 1958 and the Infant Welfare Centre in 1961. Town water was connected in 1962.


=== Meteorites ===
A meteorite known as Cranbourne meteorite No.11 was found 2 kilometres north north-east of Pearcedale and 5 kilometres east-south east of the Langwarrin Railway Station. The meteorite weighed a massive 762 kilograms and was reportedly found in 1903, just below the surface of the ground. The find was not reported at the time and, from all accounts the meteorite was kept in the possession of the finder until 1938, when it was sold to the U.S. National Museum, Washington.
Another known as Cranbourne meteorite No.12 was discovered in April 1982 it was donated to the then Shire Council for display purposes. This meteorite was first found in 1927 but only recently came to scientific notice. Weighing 23 kilograms it has been registered in the collections of the National Museum of Victoria and is on a long term loan to the City of Casey, for display purposes. It was found on a property located on the north-east corner of Pearcedale Road, Pearcedale.
In 2013 Cranbourne meteorite 13 was found at the intersection of North Road and Pearcedale Road. CSIRO took possession shortly after and it has since been classified as the third largest Mars based meteorite found in the southern hemisphere.
