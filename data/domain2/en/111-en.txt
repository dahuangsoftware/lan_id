Lycaena rauparaha, Rauparaha’s copper or mokarakare is a species of butterfly endemic to New Zealand. It acquired its English common name because it occurred in the same coastal areas as the rangatira (chief) and war leader of Ngāti Toa Maori, Te Rauparaha.


== Distribution ==
Around the westen and northern coast of the North Island and in the northern coastal areas of South Island.


== Habitat ==
Lycaena rauparaha live mainly among coastal dunes, although the species can be found in any habitat where their food plants grow.


== Biology ==
The caterpillars feed mainly on Muehlenbeckia complexa. A single egg is laid on the underside of the leaves. The larva is velvety green, and has the usual lateral lappets and dorsal ridges found in Lycaena caterpillars. It enters diapause in the colder winter months when small and in the Spring it resumes feeding. The pupa is greenish yellow with reddish brown wing cases. It is secured on a dead leaf on the ground by the cremaster and a few loose strands of silk. The period of winter inactivity is thought, at least partially, to be an adaptation to the seasonal unavailability of the food plants which are partially deciduous This species typically travels no more than 20–50 metres from their larval food plants, so suitable habiatas must have both the larval food plant and plants fed on by the adults in close proximity.
The adults of Lyceana rauparaha have a rapid jerky flight close to the ground.
