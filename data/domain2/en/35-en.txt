Founded in 1944 and incorporated by Royal Charter in 1975, The Institute of Measurement and Control (InstMC) is committed to promoting the professional excellence of engineers and technologists at all levels in measurement and control and related industries. Its aims are to advance the science and practice of measurement and control technologies and their various applications, to foster the exchange of views and the communication of knowledge and ideas in these activities, and to promote the professional qualification and standing of its members. The Institute is therefore both a learned society and a professional qualifying body occupying a niche, particularly in the automation-focussed industries.
The Institute is the member body, for the UK, with the International Measurement Confederation (IMEKO) and is the secretariat to the United Kingdom Automatic Control Council (UKACC).
