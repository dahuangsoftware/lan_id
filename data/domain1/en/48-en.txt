The men's lightweight competition of the boxing events at the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara, Mexico, was held between October 22 and 29 at the Expo Guadalajara Arena. The defending champion was Karl Dargan from the United States. Light welterweights were limited to those boxers weighing less than or equal to 60 kilograms.
The competition was a straight single-elimination tournament. Both semifinal losers were awarded bronze medals, so no boxers competed again after their first loss. Bouts consisted of four rounds of two minutes each, with one-minute breaks between rounds. Punches scored only if the white area on the front of the glove made full contact with the front of the head or torso of the opponent. Five judges scored each bout; three of the judges had to signal a scoring punch within one second for the punch to score. The winner of the bout was the boxer who scored the most valid punches by the end of the bout.
