An earth forest is a form of geomorphology caused by earth movement and erosion. It takes the form of pillars which from a distance give the impression of a forest.
There are multiple examples of earth forest in Yuanmou County in the Yunnan Province of China, in an area of about 50 square kilometers. The tallest formation has a height of 40 meters (130 ft). The features are one to two million years old. The area was opened for tourism as the Yuanmou Earth Forest (Tulin in Chinese) in 1985.
