== Fictional character background ==
The first trade paperback, Kade: Identity, was released in 2005. Set during the Iron Age, the story follows Kade as he tries to remove the Dark Veil and the demon behind the darkness. The demon Apollyon is ultimately the one who gave the order to kill all children born under the solar eclipse. Kade was one of those children and while his body died, his spirit did not. Reborn as a Child of the Black Sun he becomes an ageless warrior who has been bestowed gifts to hunt the demons of our world.
Kade spawned a spin-off title, Ezra, as well as an all-new series in 2006 titled Kade: Sun of Perdition. Artwork was supplied by then-new artist Stjepan Šejić, who has since gone on to work for Top Cow and Dynamite Entertainment.
Kade: Sun of Perdition, takes place 1000 years after Identity and is set during the Dark Ages. Kade, called "the Key to the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Chain to the Abyss of Hell", has to face once again the demon known as Apollyon. Apollyon has merged with Kamric to form the Beast known as Abbaddon. Kade and Ezra manage to banish The Beast back to the Abyss but not before The Fallen are released. The Fallen are seven angels who defied God and who are determined to bring about the Apocalypse. Just prior to being banished, Abaddon manages to free the Fallen and kill Ezra in front of a horrified Kade.
Kade: Shiva's Sun is the third series and takes place 50 years after Sun of Perdition, set in India's Golden Age. Alex Niklovitch is writing. The first issue is set for release in August 2007.
