In tennis, the 2014 US Open Series (known as Emirates Airline US Open Series for sponsorship reasons) was the eleventh edition of the US Open Series, which included nine hard court tournaments that started on July 21, 2014 in Atlanta and concluded in Winston-Salem for the men and in New Haven for the women on August 23, 2014. This edition consisted of four separate men's tournaments and three women's tournaments, with the Western & Southern Open hosting both a men's and women's event. The series was headlined by two ATP World Tour Masters 1000 and two WTA Premier 5 events. Milos Raonic and Serena Williams were the US Open Series champions in 2014. Serena Williams improved the biggest payout in professional tennis history record which she previously shared with Rafael Nadal. The new record was then set at $4 million.
