Their debut album, Backstreet Boys, was released internationally in 1996, and was certified three times platinum in Europe, and diamond in Canada. In 1997, they released their second international album, Backstreet's Back, which continued their international success. At the same time, they released their second self-titled album in the United States. It peaked at number four and eventually became the tenth best-selling album of the 1990s.
In 1999, the Backstreet Boys released their third and most successful album to date, Millennium, which entered the Billboard 200 at number one with first-week sales of 1,133,000 copies. It became the best-selling album of the year and sold over 30 million copies internationally. In the following year, they released their fourth album, Black & Blue, which also entered the Billboard 200 at number one with first-week sales of over a million copies. After the Black & Blue Tour in 2001, the Backstreet Boys entered a hiatus. They released their fifth studio album, Never Gone, in 2005. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, selling over 291,000 copies in its first week of release.

The following album, This Is Us, became their seventh consecutive album to make the top ten on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 42,000 copies. The group has also released two compilation albums, including the platinum-certified The Hits: Chapter One.
