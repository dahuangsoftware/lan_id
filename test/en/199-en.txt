Water motorsport was on the Summer Olympic Games programme in 1900. In later years the IOC deemed each event of the 1900 Olympics to be either official or unofficial. Water motorsport was regarded as unofficial. As with the official croquet events, some motorboating events satisfied three of four retrospective criteria — restriction to amateurs, international participation, open to all competitors and without handicapping. As with croquet, there were only French players. (All other official events met all four criteria.) Motorboating was also included in the 1908 Olympic Games.
