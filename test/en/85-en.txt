== History ==
In May 1970 employees of the railway company Željezničar established a women's football club of the same name in Subotica, which became a member of the sports association Jovan Mikic Spartak. ŽFK Željezničar won the first Yugoslavia women's football league in 1975. The team was later renamed Spartak, and following the break-up of Yugoslavia it played the Serbian League.
In 2011, forty years after the club's creation, Spartak won its second championship, and in the next two seasons it won both the championship and the national cup. The team couldn't make it past the qualifying round in its UEFA Champions League debut, but in its two following appearances it reached the Round of 32.
