The United Nations Associations Test of English (国際連合公用語英語検定試験, kokusai rengō kōyōgo eigo kentei shiken) (UNATE) is a standardized test of English and facts about the United Nations administered by the United Nations Association of Japan in Japan.
It is comparable to the more widely known STEP Test in Practical English, or Eiken. The test has been gaining popularity in Japan in recent years, mainly due to use of the United Nations name.


== Grades ==
The test has six grades: the Special A class (特A級, toku ei kyū), which is the most difficult, and the A, B, C, D and E classes. The Special A, A and B classes test the candidate's knowledge of Today's Guide to the United Nations, a book published by the UN Association of Japan for this purpose.
Each of the grades is considered more difficult than their similarly named counterparts of the Eiken. (The Eiken, however, does not have a Special A class).
