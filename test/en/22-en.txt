Godiva is the name of three DC Comics characters. One is a superhero, the others are supervillains.


== Publication history ==
Godiva first appeared in Super Friends #7 and was created by E. Nelson Bridwell.


== Fictional character biography ==
Dorcas Leigh is a beautiful socialite from the United Kingdom with the power to control her hair's movement. Her first mission was to assist the Elongated Man in dismantling a bomb near London. Later on, she helped Wonder Woman find the Queen Bee. She later helps Jack O'Lantern in the Crisis on Infinite Earths and assists Superman in a confrontation with Toyman.
Around this time she is part of a team of Guardians protecting Paris, France from an attacking force of Apellaxians. A nearby reporter states it is one of the largest alien groups spotted so far in the invasion.
Much later, along with other Global Guardians, she was brainwashed by the Bialyan dictactor Queen Bee, who fools the team into thinking she was going to sponsor them as heroes. While brainwashed, she and her team help the Justice League Europe battle a giant alien robot. This, unknown to the heroes, was part of a plan to increase the Guardian's standing in the eyes of the public. The robot manages to tangle up Godiva's hair with an extending arm. Metamorpho shape-shifts into scissors and cuts the arm. Godiva stresses her hair is her life and to not approach her with scissors again. Later, she and the Olympian, a future romantic interest, use her hair to help stop the now-damaged robot from falling on nearby people, who were too enthralled with the Guardians to notice the battle.
Sumaan Harvajarti, the brother of the man Queen Bee deposed, makes a move to take control of Bialya. Several fired members of the League had infiltrated the country and were confronting the Guardians. An accident has slain Little Mermaid, which the League is blamed for. Other League members arrive to quell an international incident. Sumaan destroys the Queen's brainwashing facilities, killing many innocent citizens. Ice manages to save most of the Guardians, the League and some innocent civillains. The brainwashed members regain their right minds. Jack O'Lantern seemingly dies but he was an unknown impostor to the group. The form of Doctor Mist was ravaged but he was a robot duplicate. Godiva herself suffers lacerations but is mobile right after the blast.
The Queen herself is shot to death by Sumaan, who takes control of the country.
After the events of Bialya, the Guardians drift apart. Fain Y'onia attacks her and the Olympian in London, England. This particular battle ends in his retreat, but not before he wounds her, apparently with the end cause of the loss of her powers because an explosion burnt her hair right off and knocked her out.
The struggle against and defeat of Fain takes the lives of Godiva's friends Bushmaster and Thunderlord, with Wild Huntsman missing in action, while putting the seer Tuatara from New Zealand into a coma.
Post Infinite Crisis it was revealed (in JSA Classified #19-20, Jan-Feb. 2007) that even after the events with Fain Y'onia, Godiva still had her "super hair". It was also revealed that she had become a victim of metahuman organ stealing. Her hair had been surgically removed from her scalp leaving her bald, powerless, and under the care of Doctor Klyburn and her medical staff at S.T.A.R. Laboratories. The hair had been removed under the directive of a mentally disturbed Delores Winters at her exclusive spa/clinic, and had been transplanted into the scalp of a young female pop star wanting to be something "special".
In The New 52, Godiva (Now under the alter-ego Dora Leigh) is one of the members of the relaunched Justice League International with her hair apparently restored in the wake of Flashpoint. She is appointed to the team by UN director Andre Briggs, who uses her to win the favor of a high-ranking British politician. Upon joining the League, Godiva begins to flirt with Booster Gold.
