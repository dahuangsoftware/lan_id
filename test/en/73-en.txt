The Federico Tesio Stakes is an American Thoroughbred horse race held annually at Laurel Park in Laurel, Maryland over a distance of  1 1⁄8 miles on the dirt for three-year-old horses.
Run during the latter part of April/early May, the race can be a stepping stone to the second leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series, the Preakness Stakes. Local patrons refer to the Tesio Stakes as the "Preakness Trial." Since 2016, it has been a "Win and You're In" qualifier for the Preakness.


== History ==
The race was named in honor of famous Italian breeder Federico Tesio, owner of Dormello Stud in Dormelletto, Novara. Tesio was one of the most important breeders of Thoroughbreds in the history of horse racing. His homebreds Nearco and Ribot, both great sires, dominate Thoroughbred bloodlines throughout the world. Tesio died in 1954 at age 85.
The last horse to win this race and the Preakness was Deputed Testamony in 1983. Several Tesio runners have made a major impact on the Triple Crown by placing in the Preakness during the last twenty years, including Icabad Crane in 2008, Magic Weisner in 2002, Oliver's Twist in 1995, and Rock Point in 1989 and Broad Brush in 1986. In 2011, Tesio runner-up Ruler On Ice won the Belmont Stakes and in 1998 Tesio winner Thomas Jo placed third in the Belmont Stakes.
The Federico Tesio Stakes was an American Grade III stakes race from 1986 through 1997. The race was restricted to Maryland breds from 1981 through 1985.
Prior to 2016, it was held at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland and was run over a distance of one and one-sixteenth miles.
