Sir John Baird of Newbyth, 2nd Baronet (13 October 1686 â€“ 30 September 1745) was a Scottish politician.
He was the oldest son of Sir William Baird, 1st Baronet and his first wife Helen Gilmour, daughter of Sir John Gilmour. Baird entered the British House of Commons in 1715, sitting as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Edinburghshire until 1722. In 1737, he succeeded his father as baronet.
Baird married Janet Dalrymple, only daughter of Sir David Dalrymple, 1st Baronet. Their marriage was childless. Baird died, aged 58 in Berwick-upon-Tweed and with his death the baronetcy became extinct. The heir of his estates was his cousin William, the father of Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet. Baird's widow remarried James St Clair and died in 1766.
