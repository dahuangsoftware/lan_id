Easy Read is a method of presenting written English to make it easier to understand for people with learning disabilities.
Typically, Easy Read uses sentences that should be no more than ten to 15 words, and each sentence should have just one idea and one verb. Active sentences are used instead of passive sentences. Easy Read is closely edited, to express ideas in a small number of simple words. Any difficult word or idea is explained in a separate sentence.
The Plain English statement: "Thank you for your letter asking for permission to put up posters in the library. Before we can give you an answer we will need to see a copy of the posters to make sure they wonâ€™t offend anyone." could be rewritten to Easy Read as follows: "Thank you for your letter about your poster. We need to see the poster before we put it up. This is because it must not offend anyone. Offend means upset people."
An Easy Read document is usually presented in at least 14-point text, is limited to 24 pages of content, and often uses carefully-selected images to support comprehension.
The UK Government promotes the use of Easy Read across the public sector, in order to increase access to public services.
