Critical reception has been mixed. Dread Central criticized the film's vampires for not being "all that menacing or compelling" while also stating that "Bloodsuckers easily ranks one of the Sci-Fi Channels most entertaining original productions yet." DVD Talk shared similar sentiments, writing "Chock full of bad acting, ridiculously pulpy dialogue, and tons of sloppily satisfying gore, Vampire Wars is by all conceivable measures a pretty awful movie. But that doesn't mean I didn't have some fun with it!"
