Harcharan Garewal (1934/35 â€“ 6 May 1990) was a noted Punjabi singer.  He is known for his songs like Tota Pee Gia Bullan Di Laali, and duets with Surinder Kaur like Lakk Hille Majajan Jaandi Da, Main Vi Jatt Ludhiane Da, Aa Gia Wanjara Ni Charha Lai Bhabi Churhian and with Seema like Mittran De Tubewell 'te. Many Punjabi singers used to accompany him on stage with music instruments or so before releasing their own records including Kuldeep Manak.


== Life and career ==
Garewal was born in 1934/35 in village Jodhan Mansuran in Layallpur district (renamed Faisalabad District) in British Punjab. After the Partition of Punjab in 1947, his family moved to Jamalpur Awana Ludhiana area in Indian Punjab.
He never sung, even in his college time, until he listened to Lal Chand Yamla Jatt. Inspired by him, he started learning music from Jaswant Bhanwra. He first sung solos and later sung duets with many female singers including Surinder Kaur, Seema, Narinder Biba and Swaran Lata.
