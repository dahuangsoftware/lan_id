== Club career ==
Paulo Jorge was born in Maia, Porto District. After six seasons in the second division with F.C. Maia (this included loan spells in the lower leagues with Pedrouços A.C. and FC Infesta), he joined Boavista F.C. for 2005–06.
After a solid Primeira Liga spell at the latter, where he scored seven goals across all competitions, clubs like Valencia CF and PSV Eindhoven showed interest in acquiring Paulo Jorge's services but, after turning down an offer from champions FC Porto, he signed for S.L. Benfica in July 2006. In his first game with the Lisbon team, he netted their only goal against AEK Athens F.C. in a pre-season 1–3 defeat, after which he started in UEFA Champions League matches against FK Austria Wien and F.C. Copenhagen, the latter in the group stage.
However, after having appeared sparingly during the league campaign, Paulo Jorge was loaned to Spanish side Málaga CF, which achieved La Liga promotion in 2008. He shared teams with countrymen Eliseu and Hélder Rosário during his stint.
In mid-July 2008, Paulo Jorge was definitely sold and joined fellow league club C.S. Marítimo in Madeira. He scored his first official goal on 4 January 2009 during a 4–1 home win against F.C. Paços de Ferreira, and spent most of the season as a right back.
