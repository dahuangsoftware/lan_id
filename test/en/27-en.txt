François Barthélemy Michel Édouard Cibot (1799–1877) was a French historical and landscape painter born in Paris. His masters were Guérin and Picot. During the first part of his career he devoted himself to historical painting, producing many sacred works, several specimens of which are to be seen in the churches of Paris. His most important work of this kind is the series of paintings representing 'Charity,' in the church of St. Leu at Paris. About 1863 he applied himself to landscape painting. He died in Paris in 1877. Amongst his best works are:

The Loves of the Angels. 1835.
Regina Coeli. 1846.
St. Theresa. 1847.
Convicts in 1788. 1836.
