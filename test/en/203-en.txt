The school buildings are located on North Road, east of Lynnwood. The funding for construction was approved in 2006 and construction began in June 2007, after a wooded area was logged.
Designed by Bassetti Architects, the building was opened on September 8, 2009 It is configured around a central common space called The Agora, named after the Greek word for "place of assembly" and "marketplace".

The gymnasium and performing arts wings are designed to function separately from the rest of the building outside of normal school hours.


=== Green features ===
The new school has many environmentally friendly features such as skylights to bring in natural sunlight into the building instead of using lighting. Despite protests from some environmental groups, the school was built on a wooded area. West of the new football field are the remaining evergreen trees in a protected wetland. A natural area to the north of the school is protected wetland with a pond and trees. A storm water detention pond north of the football field diverts potentially polluted water from going into local creeks and waterways. Classrooms are not air conditioned but have natural convection ventilation. The buildings have received an Energy Star design certification. Its expected energy use is a reduction of 44 percent compared with an average building of similar type.
