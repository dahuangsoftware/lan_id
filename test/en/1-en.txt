== Club career ==
After a spell as a youngster at Tottenham Hotspur, which spanned from the ages of 10-16, Young signed scholarship forms at Southampton at aged 16, and signed his first professional contract for Southampton in May 2012. After a good spell with the south coast side, he left the club in the summer of 2014 to join Sheffield Wednesday. He signed a one-year contract with Sheffield Wednesday on 3 June 2014. On 10 January 2015, he signed for Carlisle United on a one-month loan deal. He made his Football League debut later that day in a 1–0 loss to Cambridge United. Only Three games into his loan spell, he extended his stay at Carlisle United on loan for the rest of the season. He made twenty appearances, all of which came as starts, for the League Two side. After his loan spell ended in May 2015, he was one of eleven players to leave Sheffield Wednesday. Matt has been regarded by coaches that have worked with him to be one of the most hardworking, dedicated and mentally strongest players in the modern game.
In July 2015, Young spent pre season with National League club Barrow. Following his short spell at Barrow, he signed for fellow National League club Dover Athletic on 7 August 2015. His first appearance for the club came off from the bench on the first game of the season in a 2–1 defeat against Barrow.
Young signed for Kidderminster Harriers in October 2015 on a deal until the end of the year. He made 10 first team appearances, including a game winning assist in a home game versus Woking which ended the Harriers wretched run of form. He went on to join Isthmian League Premier Division club Billericay Town at the start of the 2016–17 season, making six appearances before departing in September to go on trial with League Two club Exeter City.
On 30 September 2016, Young joined Chelmsford City. He left the club again at the end of the season.
On 3 August 2017, Young joined Woking two days before the season was due to start. On 15 August 2017, Young made his Woking debut during their 2–1 home victory over Eastleigh, replacing Louis Ramsay in the 89th minute. On 28 August 2017, Young replaced Norwich City loanee, Louis Ramsay in the starting lineup to make his first start for the Cards during their impressive 4–1 home victory against Torquay United.
