The Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ  (Ukrainian: Собор Святого Воскресіння ) also called Cathedral of the Resurrection of Our Saviour Is the name given to a historic religious building in the city of Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine which functions as a Catholic cathedral and seat of the Ivano-Frankivsk Eparchy (Archieparchia Stanislaopolitanus) using the Byzantine or Ukrainian rite (Greek Catholic) in full communion with the Pope in Rome.
The original church belonged to the Jesuits and was built between 1720 and 1729, but this structure was demolished as a result of technical errors. The present Baroque style church was built between 1752 and 1761 by the ruler of the city, the governor of Poznan and Kiev Stanisława Potockiego. Since 1885 it is a greek-Catholic cathedral. It is right next to an old monastery.
The baroque church, has three naves and a facade of two towers. It is under the pastoral responsibility of Archbishop Volodymyr Viytyshyn who was ratified by Pope Benedict XVI in 2005.
