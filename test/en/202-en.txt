== History ==
Ethan Miller, while still with Comets on Fire, felt the urge to pursue a more melodic sound in his music and express the influence of growing up on the Lost Coast, so he formed Howlin' Rain with his former high school band-mate Ian Gradek, and drummer John Moloney (who is now with the neo-folk ensemble Sunburned Hand of the Man). After the 2006 release of Comets on Fire's last album, he released Howlin' Rain's self-titled debut album on Birdman Records and began touring with Queens of the Stone Age.
Shortly after the release of their first album, Moloney left the band. after which Garett Goddard (The Cuts), Eli Eckert and Joel Robinow (both of Drunk Horse) were added. The band's second album Magnificent Fiend was released in 2008. The EP Wild Life followed later that year.
The Russian Wild's incarnation of the group features Ethan Miller and Joel Robinow, along with a new rhythm section composed of Cyrus Comiskey (Drunk Horse, ex-Saviours) and Raj Ojha. The group also featured Isaiah Mitchell (Earthless) on lead guitar.
The band was chosen personally by Belle & Sebastian to perform at their second Bowlie Weekender festival presented by All Tomorrow's Parties in the UK in December 2010. In late 2010 Howlin' Rain released the EP The Good Life in digital format, followed by a limited vinyl edition in early 2011 via American and Birdman records. The album The Russian Wilds was released in February 2012. Midway through The Russian Wilds touring in 2012, band member Joel Robinow left Howlin Rain unexpectedly, leaving the band as a four-piece. 
On April 29, 2014, Howlin Rain released a live album, Live Rain, recorded at multiple shows from the 2012 tour promoting The Russian Wilds.
On January 27, 2015, Howlin Rain released an album of new material called Mansion Songs. It was Howlin Rain's first release on Easy Sound Records. In the press release Miller discussed the new album. “I walked out of the back end of my major label run and the first 9 years in Howlin Rain with no band, no label, no foreseeable immediate move forward and a figurative suitcase full of songs, my talent, invigorated by having nothing else to lose, exhausted by the bulls-- and grind of the music business, this musical life, and all it’s absolute bulls-- and f-- tests, cynical but not bitter. I still wanted to make more records. I wanted to track the journey from nothingness back to creation in musical form in a set of three albums and rock bottom was the perfect place to start from. There’s nothing to fake down here! It’s a dark and beautiful and pure cave to create something truthful from. The first album in the trilogy is Mansion Songs.”
